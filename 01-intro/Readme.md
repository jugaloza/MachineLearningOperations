# Introduction to Machine learning Operations

<h2> What is MLOps </h2>

Machine learning is not only about modelling and selecting appropriate network architecture or method for solving any business problem. Even 99 % accurate model deteriorates over time 
and most of the bussiness suffers from this because they dont have strategies to deploy and monitor the machine learning models. There comes the Machine learning Operations come to the rescue.

Machine Learning Operations(MLOps) is methodology for maintaining ML systems. Similar to DevOps, MLOps looks to increase the automation and improve the quality of ML models,
without hampering the business needs.

Using MLOps, organization can efficiently and reliably transition the model to production.

Phases of MLOps:

1. Data Gathering
2. Data Processing
3. Data Cleaning
4. Model Training and development
5. Model Evaluation
6. Model Serving
7. Model Monitoring
8. Model Re-Training
